<p>This radiometric sub-collection of the Geoscience Australia
Geophysics Reference Data Collection are compilations of radiometric
data from an extensive archive of geophysical surveys dating back to
1947, which are contained in other sub-collections of this collection.
The individual survey datasets have been acquired by Geoscience
Australia and its State and Territory Government partners. The
compilations of radiometric data involved the levelling and merging
(mosaicking) of regularly interpolated grid (raster) data, from selected
individual geophysical surveys, into near-seamless national scale grids
for each datatype and creating derivations thereof. The selected
individual surveys are chosen based on the spatial resolution and
accuracy of individual surveys within a given area.</p>

<li>title: Radiometric Grid of Australia (Radmap) v4 2019 unfiltered
terrestrial dose rate</li>
<li>description: The unfiltered terrestrial dose rate grid is a
derivative of the 2019 radiometric or gamma-ray grid of Australia, which
is a merge of over 600 individual gamma-ray spectrometric surveys. The
radiometric, or gamma-ray spectrometric method, measures the natural
variations in the gamma-rays detected near the Earth’s surface as the
result of the natural radioactive decay of potassium (K), uranium (U)
and thorium (Th). The data are collected on airborne geophysical surveys
conducted by Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments and
the private sector.The unfiltered terrestrial dose rate grid is derived
as a linear combination of the unfiltered K, U and Th grids, and has a
cell size of about 100m (0.001 degrees).</li>

combination of over 600 individual survey grids. The radiometric, or
gamma-ray spectrometric method, measures the natural variations in the
gamma-rays detected near the Earth’s surface as the result of the
natural radioactive decay of potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium
(Th). The data are collected on airborne geophysical surveys conducted
by Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments and the
private sector.The terrestrial dose rate grid is derived as a linear
combination of the filtered K, U and Th grids. A low pass filter is
applied to the unfiltered grid to generate the filtered terrestrial dose
rate grid. The grid cell size is about 100m (0.001 degrees).</li>

Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Governments and the private
sector. The 2019 unfiltered potassium grid has a cell size of about 100
m (0.001 degrees) and shows potassium element concentrations of the
Australia region. Potassium is the seventh most abundant element in the
Earth’s crust. The potassium concentration grid can be used to locate
minerals and compounds containing potassium.</li>
