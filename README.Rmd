`dataharvester` is an R interface to the [AgReFed Data Harvester]().
Use `dataharvester` to preprocess, aggregate, visualise and download geospatial data from a range of Australian and international data sources, including:

- [Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)]()
- [SILO Climate Database]()
- [Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Australia]()
- [Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Geoscience Earth Observations]()
- [GSKY Data Server for DEA Geoscience Earth Observations]()
- [Google Earth Engine]()

With connectivity to the Earth Engine API, perform petabyte-scale operations which include temporal cloud/shadow masking and automatic calculation of spectral indices (e.g. NDVI) for the following collections:

- Landsat [5]() (TM), [7]() (ETM+), [8]() (OLI/TRS) and [9]() (OLI-2/TRS-2)
- [Sentinel-2]() (Surface Reflectance) and [Sentinel-3]() (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument)
- [MODIS](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/modis) (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products

For [all other Earth Engine collections](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/), while `dataharvester` does not provide officual support, users can still perform basic operations to filter, reduce, visualise and download data.

## Installation

Download the development version of this package from GitHub using `install_github()`:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes") # uncomment and run this line if necessary
remotes::install_github("januarharianto/dataharvester")

library(dataharvester) # load package
```


## `start_harvester()`

The heart *and* soul of `dataharvester`, `start_harvester()` helps you initialise the package, verifies package dependenies and connect to the Earth Engine API. The [online documentation]() provides a detailed outlook on what the function does.


## Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(dataharvester)
start_harvester(earthengine = TRUE)

# todo

```
