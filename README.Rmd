`dataharvester` is an R interface to the AgReFed Data Harvester.
Use `dataharvester` to preprocess, aggregate, visualise and download geospatial data from a range of Australian and international data sources, including:

- [Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA)](https://is.gd/i8nF0Z)
- [SILO Climate Database](https://is.gd/ifJ8tB)
- [Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Australia](https://is.gd/ZLFwGs)
- [Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Geoscience Earth Observations](https://is.gd/gRSlVG)
- [GSKY Data Server for DEA Geoscience Earth Observations](https://is.gd/zFHxfD)
- [Google Earth Engine](https://is.gd/VdO3Jx)

With connectivity to the Earth Engine API, perform petabyte-scale operations which include temporal cloud/shadow masking and automatic calculation of spectral indices (e.g. NDVI) for the following collections:

- Landsat [5](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-5) (TM), [7](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-7) (ETM+), [8](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8) (OLI/TRS) and [9](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-9) (OLI-2/TRS-2)
- [Sentinel-2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2) (Surface Reflectance) and [Sentinel-3](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S3_OLCI) (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument)
- [MODIS](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/modis) (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products

For [all other Earth Engine collections](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/), while `dataharvester` does not provide officual support, users can still perform basic operations to filter, reduce, visualise and download data.

## Installation

**Important**: `dataharvester` is currently still under early development. **Many things are broken** and this repository is public so that our community developers can access it.  **Do not download this package unless you are a developer and love to break things!**

Download the development version of this package from GitHub using `install_github()`:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes") # uncomment and run this line if necessary
remotes::install_github("januarharianto/dataharvester")

library(dataharvester) # load package
```


## `initialise_harvester()`

The heart *and* soul of `dataharvester`, `intialise_harvester()` helps you initialise the package, verifies package dependencies and connect to the Earth Engine API. The online documentation (currently not available) provides a detailed outlook on what the function does.


## Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# library(dataharvester)
# initialise(earthengine = TRUE)

# todo

```
